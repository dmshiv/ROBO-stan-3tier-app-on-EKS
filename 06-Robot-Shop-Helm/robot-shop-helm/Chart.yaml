# HELM CHART METADATA - Chart.yaml
# =============================================================================
# Think of this file as the "ID card" or "passport" for your Helm chart.
# It tells Helm:
#   - What is this chart called?
#   - What version is it?
#   - Where did it come from?
#
# WHAT IS A HELM CHART?
# ---------------------
# A Helm chart is like a "package" or "installer" for Kubernetes applications.
# Instead of manually writing 20+ YAML files, Helm bundles them together
# and lets you install the entire app with one command: `helm install`
#
# WHY USE HELM?
# -------------
# 1. REUSABILITY: Write once, deploy many times with different settings
# 2. TEMPLATING: Use variables ({{ .Values.xxx }}) instead of hardcoding
# 3. VERSIONING: Track changes and rollback if something breaks
# 4. DEPENDENCIES: Manage complex apps with multiple services
# =============================================================================

# API Version: Which Helm specification this chart follows
# v1 = Helm 2 (older), v2 = Helm 3 (newer, but v1 still works in Helm 3)
apiVersion: v1

# Name: The unique identifier for this chart
# Used when installing: `helm install my-release robot-shop`
name: robot-shop

# Version: The chart version (NOT the app version)
